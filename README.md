# Mn_3X
codes for calculating the spin-wave dispersions in the stacked kagome compounds Mn_3X. There is a generic code case done in the file "generic_triang_dis". 
The generic code is for any triangular order antiferromanget (local C_3 symmetric). The individual file descriptions are:

1. 6-unit-cell-velocities-gradients : This notebook calculates the spin wave dispersion for the kagome-bilayer.
2. basic-geometry-of-the-modes : This notebook contains the field theory normal modes for the triangular AFM where the order parameter is a 120 degree ordered spin plaquette
3. generic-kag-triang-disp : This notebook computes the spin wave dispersions for a single layer of a kagome and a triangular spin lattice using the normal modes developed in file (2).
4.strain-details_OT_conv : This notebook adds the features of straining the kagome lattice on the spin wave dispersions in (1).
